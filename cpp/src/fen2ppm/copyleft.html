<P>

The simplest way to make a program free is to put it in the

<A HREF="/philosophy/categories.html#PublicDomainSoftware">public
domain (18k characters)</A>, uncopyrighted.  This allows people to
share the program and their improvements, if they are so minded.  But
it also allows uncooperative people to convert the program into

<A HREF="/philosophy/categories.html#ProprietarySoftware">proprietary
software (18k characters)</A>.  They can make changes, many or few,
and distribute the result as a proprietary product.  People who
receive the program in that modified form do not have the freedom that
the original author gave them; the middleman has stripped it away.

<P>
In the <A HREF="/gnu/thegnuproject.html">GNU project</A>, our aim
is to give <em>all</em> users the freedom to redistribute and change
GNU software.  If middlemen could strip off the freedom, we might have
many users, but those users would not have freedom.  So instead of
putting GNU software in the public domain, we ``copyleft'' it.
Copyleft says that anyone who redistributes the software, with or
without changes, must pass along the freedom to further copy and
change it.  Copyleft guarantees that every user has freedom.

<P>
Copyleft also provides an
<A HREF="/philosophy/pragmatic.html">incentive</A>
for other programmers to add to free software.
Important free programs such as the GNU C++ compiler exist
only because of this.

<P>
Copyleft also helps programmers who want to contribute <A
HREF="/software/software.html#HelpWriteSoftware">improvements</A> to
<A HREF="/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</A> get permission to
do that.  These programmers often work for companies or universities
that would do almost anything to get more money.  A programmer may
want to contribute her changes to the community, but her employer may
want to turn the changes into a proprietary software product.

<P>
When we explain to the employer that it is illegal to distribute the
improved version except as free software, the employer usually decides
to release it as free software rather than throw it away.

<P>
To copyleft a program, first we copyright it; then we add distribution
terms, which are a legal instrument that gives everyone the rights to
use, modify, and redistribute the program's code <em>or any program
derived from it</em> but only if the distribution terms are unchanged.
Thus, the code and the freedoms become legally inseparable.

<P>
Proprietary software developers use copyright to take away the users'
freedom; we use copyright to guarantee their freedom.  That's why we
reverse the name, changing ``copyright'' into ``copyleft.''

<P>
Copyleft is a general concept; there are many ways to fill in the
details.  In the GNU Project, the specific distribution terms that we
use are contained in the

<A HREF="/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public License (available in
HTML</A>, <A HREF="/copyleft/gpl.txt">text</A>, and <A
HREF="/copyleft/gpl.texi">Texinfo</A> format)</A>.  The GNU General
Public License is often called the GNU GPL for short.

<P>

An alternate form of copyleft, the

<A HREF="/copyleft/lesser.html">GNU Lesser General Public License
(LGPL) (available in HTML</A>, <A HREF="/copyleft/lesser.txt">text</A>,
and <A HREF="/copyleft/lesser.texi">Texinfo</A> format), applies to a few
(but not all) GNU libraries. This license was formerly called the
Library GPL, but we changed the name, because the old name encouraged
to use this license more often than it should be used. For an
explanation of why this change was necessary, read the article <A
HREF="/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html"><CITE>Why you shouldn't use the Library
GPL for your next library</CITE></A>.

<P>

The <A HREF="/copyleft/library.html">GNU Library General Public License
(available in HTML</A> and <A HREF="/copyleft/library.txt"> text format)</A> is
still available though it has officially been replaced by the Lesser GPL.

<P>

The <A HREF="/copyleft/fdl.html">GNU Free Documentation License (FDL)
(available in HTML</A>, <A HREF="/copyleft/fdl.txt">text</A> and <A
HREF="/copyleft/fdl.texi">Texinfo)</A> is a form of copyleft intended
for use on a manual, textbook or other document to assure everyone the
effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
modifications, either commercially or noncommercially.

<P>
The appropriate license is included in many manuals and in each GNU
source code distribution.

<P>
The GNU GPL is designed so that you can easily apply it to your own
program if you are the copyright holder.  You don't have to modify the
GNU GPL to do this, just add notices to your program which refer
properly to the GNU GPL.

<P>
If you would like to copyleft your program with the GNU GPL, please
see the instructions at the
<A HREF="/copyleft/gpl.html#SEC4">end (20k characters)</A> of the GPL text.
If you would like to copyleft your program with the GNU LGPL, please
see the instructions at the
<A HREF="/copyleft/lesser.html#SEC4">end (27k characters)</A> of the LGPL text.

<P>
Using the same distribution terms for many different programs makes it
easy to copy code between various different programs.  Since they all
have the same distribution terms, there is no need to think about
whether the terms are compatible.  The Lesser GPL includes a
provision that lets you alter the distribution terms to the ordinary
GPL, so that you can copy code into another program covered by the
GPL.

<P>
<H4><A HREF="/copyleft/copyleft.html#TOCtranslations"
       NAME="translations">Translations of the GPL</A></H4>
<P>
These translations are not official.  Legally speaking, the original
(English) version of the GPL is what specifies the actual distribution
terms for GNU programs.

<P>
The reason the FSF does not approve these translations as officially
valid is that checking them would be difficult and expensive (needing
the help of bilingual lawyers in other countries).  Even worse, if an
error did slip through, the results could be disastrous for the whole
free software community.  As long as the translations are unofficial,
they can't do any harm, and we hope they help more people understand
the GPL.

<P>
We give permission to publish translations of the GPL, GFDL, or LGPL
into other languages, provided that you (1) label your
translations as unofficial (see below for how to do this), to
inform people that they do not count legally as substitutes for
the authentic version, and (2) you agree to install changes at our
request, if we learn from other friends of GNU that changes are
necessary to make the translation clearer.
<P>

To label your translations as unofficial we want you to add the
following text at the beginning,
both in English and in the language of the translation---replacing
<em>language</em> with the name of that language:
<blockquote>
This is an unofficial translation of the GNU General Public License
into <em>language</em>.  It was not published by the Free Software
Foundation, and does not legally state the distribution terms for
software that uses the GNU GPL--only the original English text of the
GNU GPL does that.  However, we hope that this translation will help
<em>language</em> speakers understand the GNU GPL better.
